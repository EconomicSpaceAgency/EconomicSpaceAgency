### Computing fabric

World Computing Fabric is a modular, object capability-oriented architecture for building resilient, verifiable networks of virtual machines. This enables a new approach for creating systems and protocols for the digital economy. 

Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on the same computing idea, a "World Computer", run by every node on the network, processing every line of application code run by every application in the system. This replication has tremendous benefits in terms of transparency and fault tolerance. However, the World Computer architecture introduces redundancies and limitations that can be inconvenient and inefficient for many applications. Smart contract-based applications have become varied enough so as to benefit from more flexibility than the World Computer architecture typically offers.

Instead of a World Computer implementation, [[#Gravity]] offers a platform for building interoperating networks of decentralized computers – a [[#World Computing Fabric]] architecture.

## D

### DAO

Distributed Autonomous Organization

### Dividual

The actors in economic spaces can be seen as dividuals, not individuals. Think about the way in which attention, “liking”, gossiping, smiling and so on have become economic acts, and how they are aggregated into flows. “The” economy does not want you, as an individual, not even your labour, but it wants slices of you, at unpredictable moments. In the Euclidian space, we get only the downside of this dividualism, the uncertainty, the precarity, so why not also the upside?

### <id="DPO">DPO></id>

Distributed Programmable Organization a.k.a DAO, but ECSA wants to emphasise the possibility to reprogram, even shut down and completely rewrite, a “DAO”; therefore a DPO

## E

### Econaut

As a general term: a person exploring the frontiers of economic space

As a specific term: partner of the Econaut Partnership


### Econaut Partnership

A partnership between the Core Team members of ECSA Inc. and a number of individuals, the purpose of which is to enable the ECSA platform for new generation of Econauts to easily create, launch, capture and distribute value on the Economic Spaces they create and to create a vibrant and prolific community around the Space ecosystem. 


### Economic Space

The collection of users, smart (private and/or public) contracts, resource pools and governance models to which said users have voluntarily committed, that together organise and maintain economic group activity.

On [[#Space (ECSA Platform) | Space]], economic spaces are protocols of economic, financial and social interaction, of value and risk creation, of sharing and distribution of resources. They are self-governed, peer-to-peer programmable organizations that can operate together in an emergent network, formed dynamically through the relations they establish between each other. The goal is the interoperation of a plurality of micro-economies, each with its own governance model, value creation logic and capacity for tokenized self-issuance. These micro-economies will be structurally interoperable to the extent they desire, and they will be able to utilize the structures created by others as a basis of their own operations.

### ECSA Cyber Trust

The organization responsible for the launch (ITL) of the ECSA token


### ECSA DAO

The collection of designers, developers and users of Space that together develop and govern the Space


### ECSA Inc.

Start-up with the mission of giving people the tools to design and launch projects, companies and platforms (i.e., economic spaces) aligned with their values


### Euclidean economic space

Euclidean economic space is defined by the competition of economic agents over scarce resources. The individual agents are deemed to have clear and persistent boundaries, and relate to each other via linear transactions. In a Euclidean economic space, something pre-produced is divided. This is the space the politicians and economic experts talk about when they say there is no alternative to the current economic system and ask us to blindly abide to austere monetary policies. See also [[#non-Euclidean economic space]]


## G


### Gravity

A distributed computing architecture for smart contracts and blockchains that emphasizes both resilience and interoperability, with the purpose of decentralized self-organization


## I

###  Intentional economy

The notion of an economic space can be summed  up as something that has been designed - more or less intentionally and consciously - to facilitate a set of behaviours or outcomes, and continues to be governed in a way that makes possible the further adjustment and modification of behaviours and outcomes towards its goals (which themselves may also evolve with experience). In analogy to so-called intentional communities, we think of economic spaces as intentional economies, where the purpose, membership and governance of the economy are both pre-planned and constantly under review.

### ITL

Initial Token Launch

## M

### Monoeconomy

an economy dominated by one metric of value (e.g., exchange value in terms of a fiat currency): in analogy with the term monoculture (monocropping etc.), in which one species (out of a whole spectrum of possible species) dominates the ecosystem, (not in the precise technical sense the term monoeconomy is used in development economics). “Monotheistic economy” might be another term, connoting the theistic elements discernible in current economic dogma.

## N

### non-Euclidean economic space

non-Euclidean economic spaces move beyond the imaginary of limitations, austerity, scarcity and powerlessness, foregrounding a continuous unfolding of possibilities, options, connections and creativity. When resources and affordances get shared on a distributed platform, they become nomadic and start to mutate. Non-Euclidean economic spaces call for a non-linear distribution where nothing pertains or belongs only to one person, but all persons are arrayed here and there in such a manner as to make possible a greater range of interactions. Nomadic economic spaces are the associated milieu of the networked tribes of the 21st century. Think of them as n-dimensional programmable and vibratory organizations that allow for the creation and circulation of new types of value.

## O

### Object Capability model

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model The object-capability model] is a computer security model. A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object.

### Open sourcing finance

the goal of SPACE is to become an easily usable launch pad for rapid creation, deployment, sharing, customizing, copying and remixing of modular, interoperable and self-governing economic spaces. The platform enables communities and individuals to make their own offers, issue their own programmable tokens and set their own value systems. As such, the design of economic space becomes a means of collective self-expression, that is: an occasion to enunciate and manifest financial values that escape the disfiguring market logic of generalized equivalence. Through the platform’s template approach, users have access to flexible tools to invent and construct new (or simply reproduce existing) modes of organization to leverage the unrealized value of socially networked production.

## P

### Peer Production

Peer production (also known as mass collaboration) is a way of producing goods and services that relies on self-organizing communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of a large number of people is coordinated towards a shared outcome.


## S

### Self-governance

Self-governance is the right to propose rules of governance, which the other agents can choose to acknowledge. Governance here extends from private contracts to general agreements, from accepting a certain template of identity when joining a platform (which is a form of contemporary governance often unprocessed as such) to rules of general behavioral definitions. In an economic space, self-governance means the ability to form the [[#Economic Space | economic space]] so that its dynamical aspects (attractors, state spaces, etc.) reward the desired behaviour and outcomes.

### Self-issuance

Self-issuance signifies that any agent can issue value, proposing it to other agents -- its valuation is therefore a general question for the society at large and a practical question for each individual agent, whenever they face an offer for it. In current finance, value masquerades as objective, actively suppressing the highly protean emergence of value and the variegated forms it takes. Valuation is ultimately an expression. Issuance of value and value systems is therefore a proposal to be evaluated by others, thus transforming into collective expression of value. Instead of imposing a uniform system of value upon us, like fiat currencies enforce, ECSA's key goal is to create a platform for rendering the rich, heterogeneous multiverse of values socially and financially liquid through mutual e-valuations. 
 
The possibilities introduced by self-issuance enable economic spaces to rewrite the economic playbook according to new rules and new behavioural patterns. This translates in the possibility for [[#self-governance]].


### Space (ECSA Platform)

Platform for the creation of an interoperable ecosystem of economic spaces, defined as cyber-organizations, either top-down or emergent, that have their own goals, economic logics, and economic players. Space is an open, collaborative smart contract ecosystem based on third generation blockchain technology, [[#Gravity]]

### Smart Contract

A computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract, typically running on a distributed virtual machine. On typical blockchains, the starting point of an unsafe space (open to destructive interference) means that contracting has to happen as a (programmed) limitation of interaction. On Gravity, in contrast, the starting point is a safe space (by definition contained by the capacity framework) from which an opening, an offer to join is made, by granting a right, as a creation of a new constructive interference; rather than smart contracts these could be called “smart expansive interholding”.
 
### Sub-equity

When a [[#DPO | distributed programmable organization]] can issue tokens that possess both currency and equity-like features, its offer can be structured as a sub-equity -- without the need to incorporate and issue equity. Just as a corporate equity, a sub-equity enables the tracking of risks and sharing of financial and social upsides. But as a more flexible and intermittent tool than its institutional counterpart, it can also be designed and offered case by case. The sub-equity model is particularly apt for networked production and co-operation, which is often flexible, dynamic and open-ended, both with regard to goals and timing. 

### Synthetic finance

Finance that uses financial instruments that are built out of or on top of other financial instruments

## T

### Token

On [[#Space]], tokens are not hardwired according to the functioning of the platform software, but rather can be programmed to correspond to the needs of the issues (an economic space) of the token; a token is just another kind of smart contract that is public to its users.

## W
