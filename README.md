## <a name="space">SPACE</a>

SPACE, a smart contracts system enabling the design of modular, interoperable economic spaces -- self-governed, peer-to-peer economies which can operate together in an emergent network, formed dynamically from the relations they establish between each other. The system allows the construction of economic spaces through programmable organizations, offers and tokens that function as protocols for economic, financial and social interaction. The platform provides a launchpad for rapid creation, copying and editing of economic space, aimed at both general users unfamiliar with programming and experienced developers.  Through its template approach, users have access to flexible tools to invent and construct new (or reproduce existing) modes of organization to leverage the unrealized value of socially networked production.

SPACE is
- A construction set for programmable organizations and their governance
- A platform for building and running new forms of economy
- A system of modular, copiable and interoperable tools for p2p financial instruments

## <a name="gravity">GRAVITY</a>

GRAVITY is a resilient, distributed smart contracts computational network that allows multiple independent ledgers with tunable replication and performance parameters, while maintaining easy interoperability among constellations of autonomous agents. In addition to a verifiable self-executing substrate, the Space platform relies heavily on Gravity’s features to enable its economic ecosystem. One of Gravity’s most distinguishing features is logical decentralization while allowing network wide transaction consistency, allowing the following properties:
- Autonomy: In Gravity, the Virtual Machines that execute the contract code are autonomous and self-governed while retaining interoperability.
- Privacy: VMs may have a private state and engage in private contracts, where only the parties to the contract have access rights to the shared state.
- Scalability: Networks of interoperable logical distinct VMs inherit the natural scalability properties of networks.
- Speed: Since there is no one single global state to replicate and agree upon, consistent, high speed commits, among autonomous VMs/Agents may be achieved through distributed transactions.
