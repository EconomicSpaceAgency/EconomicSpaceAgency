# ECSA Community Meetup: Guideline

Welcome pioneers, explorers, and architects of the new economic future! Join us as we work together towards open sourcing fionance and terraforming new economic space by using peer-to-peer finance and new decentralization technologies.
Events and meetups around the world are crucial for ECSA’s mission, driving new thoughts and ideas into the ecosystem, and helping to foster a happy sense of community.

Let’s get started!

This page is your guide for starting a meetup. The Core Team warmly supports community meetups and wants to help you organize a successful and pleasant session!
To that end, we want to continuously improve the info here based on your feedback, so please do not hesitate to let us know if there is something missing & if something should be clarified.

## Meetup Organizer(s)

Find, if possible, 2-3 other community members to help you with the event logistics, setup and promotion.

Use the online channels ([Slack](http://slack.ecsa.io), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecsa_team), etc.) to find other local/regional [Econauts](https://github.com/EconomicSpaceAgency/EconomicSpaceAgency/blob/master/Glossary.md#Econaut) that can get involved and help with the meetup.
Make sure you have the time to take on the responsibility of leading the group. Successful meetup groups have consistent leadership and representation.

## Content
Specify the intended audience and focus of the group: Is this for developers, those interested in financial technology, organising economic space for a community or organisation, new economic possibilities, financial access and/or financial education? Make sure that people know what they are signing up for!
Once you’ve decided on an audience, create an agenda that would be interesting to attendees. If this is the first meetup in your city, consider as an initial agenda item a discussion around the goal or focus of the group. This way you get buy-in and feedback early on from the community.

## Proposed first topics
* As a possible first topic, we suggest an introduction to the vision on terraforming economic space that is at the heart of the ECSA network. TBA are the guidelines for a session on “What is Economic Space and ECSA?”
* AMA, Ask Me Anything, team answers questions, see below for how to request a team member to participate. If it is possible to prepare and relay the questions beforehand, the answers may be of higher quality and precision. :)

## Request Core Team member to call in
You can also request someone from the Core Team to present or take part in a Q&A or AMA at the Meetup via skype/zoom/hangouts/etc. We can not guarantee that someone can make it, but we are distributed all over the globe, so chances are that someone will be awake during the time of your meetup. Requests: meetups@ecsa.io

## Logistics
Use the Meetup.com platform for user groups and name it economicspace.agency-(city)
Check that the meetup is not competing with other events and conferences in the area by checking meetup.com’s calendar for similar events, and searching to see if there are other major gatherings close by on that day.
Select an accessible venue in a central area to your city when possible. Take a look at hosting these at companies, incubator spaces, co-working spaces or other communal venues that would be interested in hosting. Factors to consider:
* Price (free is always best)
* How much space will you need?
* Is the place too loud for the meetup?

## Communications
Contact the ECSA core team at meetups@ecsa.io once you have most of the details finalized for the event. We will make sure you are listed on the official ECSA event section of our website and help you promote the event through our community channels.

Promote your event on social media and use #economicspace or @ecsa_ team to make sure to have other community members spread the word once they join the group.

During the event, encourage people to post pictures and videos with the hashtags so the community can follow along and get involved.

## Branding/Assets
Please use the [ECSA assets and logos available to download](https://github.com/EconomicSpaceAgency/EconomicSpaceAgency/tree/master/brandingassets)

If you would like any presentation materials, one-sheets or any other documentation, please email us and we will send a link for you to download and distribute.

## Follow-up
Finally, when your meetup is over, please send us pictures, videos and feedback on how it went. We want to be your partner in making your meetup as successful as possible so your feedback is welcomed and appreciated. We look forward to working with you!
