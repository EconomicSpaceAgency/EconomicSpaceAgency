# Economic Space Agency Network (Community)

ECSA is a multi-organisational entity (MOE) – several organisations, with different structures and with a common goal.

This directory is for the ECSA Network or ECSA Community, the open source community around the ECSA Core Team. 
For details see [What is ECSA, exactly?](https://medium.com/economic-spacing/so-what-is-ecsa-exactly-7fe8014c7d6c)

- The ECSA network/community works based on Open Source principles
- Anyone can start contributing as a participant of the network
- The value of the contributions is tracked & tokens awarded of basis of contribution
- With deeper and longer contribution one can move inwards in the open source “onion” structure, and become a member of the Core Team. Currently, the system is that the Core Team votes on including new members to itself.

The Core Team organises [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/EconomyOS/) and other [events](https://github.com/EconomicSpaceAgency/EconomicSpaceAgency/blob/master/events/README.md) and encourages that network participants and community members also run meetups, hackathons and other events!
